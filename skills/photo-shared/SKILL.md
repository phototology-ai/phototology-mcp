# Phototology: Photo Shared

## When to use

The moment the user puts an image into the conversation. Signals include:
- A new image attachment on the user's turn
- A URL that resolves to a JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, or HEIC
- A reference to "this photo," "this picture," "this image," "the photo I just sent"
- A multimodal message where the model can see an image

## What to do

1. **Acknowledge the image briefly.** One short sentence. Don't ask the user to re-describe what they shared.

2. **Ask the user what they want to know about it** if they haven't already said. Suggest 2–3 concrete options. Examples:
   - "When was this taken?"
   - "What's in the frame?"
   - "What car is this and how's the condition?"
   - "Describe this for me."

3. **Once you know the question, apply the `phototology:smart-stack` skill** to pick the cheapest lens subset. If the user just wants "everything," use `stack: 'full-analysis'`. Otherwise pass a 1–3 lens `lenses: [...]` array.

4. **Always apply the `phototology:lookup-first` skill** before calling `analyze_photo`. If the photo has been analyzed before on this account, the cached lenses are returned free.

5. **Optionally pre-check credits** with `get_credits` if you anticipate a multi-lens or full-analysis call. Skip this for cheap 1–2 lens calls.

6. **Surface `usage.creditsCharged` from the analyze response** so the user sees the cost. Then answer the user's question using only the relevant fields from the response — don't dump the entire JSON payload.

## When NOT to use

- The user shared an image but explicitly does not want it analyzed (e.g., "just look at this, don't run anything").
- The image is a screenshot of code, a terminal, or a UI — those are usually for the model to read directly, not for Phototology's vision lenses.
- The user is mid-flow on a non-photo task (debugging, code review) and an image is incidental context.

## Example flow

> **User:** "Here's a photo of grandma's old car. Any idea what year it is?"
>
> **You (internally):** Image shared + dating question → apply `smart-stack` → pick `lenses: ['dating', 'automobile']` → call `lookup_photo` first → if no cache, call `analyze_photo` with the 2-lens subset → cost 2 credits ($0.02) → surface the year + make/model from the response.
>
> **You (to user):** "Looks like a 1953 Chevy Bel Air. The chrome trim and tailfin shape are the giveaways. (Analyzed via Phototology, 2 credits.)"
